## **Lexcube Visualization of DAS Records**

This repository is dedicated to building and visualizing interactive 3D Data Cubes from DAS (Distributed Acoustic Sensing) records.

To showcase the workflow, we use a 10 min long DAS record section from Rhonegletscher (Switzerland) from 2020 including 100 channels. We first fourier transform the time series records to compute spectrograms (1-100 Hz), which we organize as a 3D data cube with the axes time, frequency and DAS channel. The data cube is stored as cryo_subcube.zarr and visualized using lexcube.

## Features

- **Cube Creation**: Automated processing of DAS data including 1) Fast Fourier Transformation of the DAS time series data and 2) Data Cube generation of the DAS data in spectral domain (zarr-formatted). 
- **Cube Visualization**: Visualization of the spectral Data Cube using Lexcube (https://www.lexcube.org/) in a Python based Jupyter notebook.

## Getting Started

### Installation and Environment

The workflow requires a set of libraries stored in `requirements.txt`, which need to be installed in your preferred environment (e.g. conda) 

### Cube Creation

To create the zarr-formatted spectral Data Cube from cryoseismological DAS records, execute:
`python create_cube.py 24`

This script generates a Data Cube for a couple of minutes of a specific day (24/07/2020) of DAS data recorded at the Rhonegletscher (Switzerland). The resulting Data Cube features a spectrogram for each DAS channel and stored as cryo_subcube.zarr.

### Cube Visualization

To visualize the zarr-fomatted Data Cube (cryo_subcube.zarr), execute the notebook: 
`lexcube_visualization.ipynb`

## Get in touch with us

ScaDS.AI (Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence) Dresden/Leipzig is a center for Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data with locations in Dresden and Leipzig. It is one of the five new AI centers in Germany funded under the federal governmentâ€™s AI strategy by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the Free State of Saxony. It is established as a permanent research facility at both locations with strong connections to the local universities: the TUD Dresden University of Technology and the Leipzig University. 
In the ScaDS.AI Earh & Environmental Sciene group (https://scads.ai/research/applied-ai-and-big-data/environment-and-earth-sciences/), we develop and apply multimodal and multiscale machine learning techniques and visualization tools that respect the characteristics and the heterogeneity of Earth System Science data.
